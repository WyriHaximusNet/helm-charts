Congratulations you can now reach you Commento installation at: https://{{ $.Values.ingress.host }}

{{- if eq (.Values.application.forbidNewOwners) false }}
It looks like you've set forbidNewOwners to "false". If you intend for anyone to sign up and add sites to your installations that is fine, but.
If you don't want anyone to be able to sign up and add sites, it is recommended to set forbidNewOwners to "true".
{{- end }}
